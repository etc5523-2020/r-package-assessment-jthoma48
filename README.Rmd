[![R build status](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-jthoma48/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-jthoma48/actions)

The goal of *cov20* is to provide the user the opportunity to launch an interactive shiny application and visualize the statistics related to coronavirus from around the world. The package also contains a function that will help the user launch the application. In order to launch the application, 3 datasets have been included in this package.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of cov20 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("cov20") -->
<!-- ``` -->

A development version of the package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-jthoma48")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to launch the app:

```r
library(cov20)
launch_app()
```

This is a basic example of how you can access a dataset and visualize it however you want:

```r
library(cov20)
data2
```

You can access these datasets: data2, data3 and data5

## Functions

Besides the `launch_app()` function, there are 2 more functions in this package:

1. `selectui01()`: creates a drop-down list and displays options for countries and states to select from in the application

```r
selectui01(inputId)
```

2. `leafserv()`: generates a map of your desired country in the application

```r
leafserv(df$Long, df$Lat, df$State)
```
